XXREPLACESENDERHANDLEXX: How did you like the game in Boston?
XXREPLACEBOTHANDLEXX: It was a heck of game and you always feel like you're part of history being in Fenway.  I can't believe the Jays lost by 1 though... so close!
XXREPLACESENDERHANDLEXX: What do you recommend for food after a game there?
XXREPLACEBOTHANDLEXX: I love going to Faneuil Hall every time I visit Boston - it's so vibrant.  We checked out The Black Rose and tried the burger.  Definitely recommend!
